# SP500-Trading

Attempting to make a profit in the stock market...

## Project Outline

The aim of this project is to use minute by minute stock price and trading volume data for each company in the S&P 500 index in order to predict which stock prices will end the day on a high relative to their price earlier in the day.

The key steps involved are:

- Collect price and volume date using [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/)

- Preprocess this data (removing subpar data, padding & interpolation of missing values in useable data)

- Engineer some additional time series as input features

- Experiment with different classifier models to see which works best (if any)

- Backtest model to check for reliability

- Deploy model for automated trading

- Profit...
